Array Copy
==========
let arr1 = [10, 20];
let arr2 = arr1;  // address/reference copy ( Not value copy)
-A new array is not being created, rather same address is being assigned to arr2
-Both arr1 & arr2 are holding the same address

let arr1 = [10, 20, [30, 31]];
let arr2 = [...arr1]; // value copy - shallow copy

let arr3 = [10, 20, [30, 31]];
let arr4 = structuredClone(arr3); // value copy - Deep Copy

-A shallow copy of an array is a copy whose nested elements share the same references.
 (Nested arrays will not be copied by value)
-A deep copy of an array is a copy whose nested elements do not share the same references.



Class 
=====
class - structure/blueprint/template for creating Object 
		class has only logical existance
		class doesn't have physical existance
		
object - Real Entity
		 every instance of a class
		 Object has physical existance

-a class in javascript is created using constructor function(ES-5).
-a class in javascript is created using class keyword.(ES-6).
-class contains variables(states/properties) and methods(behaviours) inside it.


Prototype
---------
-A prototype is an object used to implement structure, state, and behaviour inheritance.
-Prototype is the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another
-Prototype is an object, where we can attach methods and properties,which enables all the other objects to inherit these methods and properties.
-Prototype is a base class for all the objects, and it helps us to achieve inheritance.
-All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
-properties added to the prototype of a class gets available to all the objects of that class.
-prototype should be used When we have to add new properties like variables and methods 
at a later point of time,and these properties needs to be shared across all the instances, 
-a property should be added to the constructor of a class if value of the property changes per object
-a property should be added to the prototype of a class if the value remains same for all objects.
